MOP: Occlusion Core is the extension of [MOP](https://github.com/Athlon007/MOP). This extension restores the [occlusion culling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidden-surface_determination#Occlusion_culling).

Warning! Occlusion Culling core is highly experimental and may cause worse performance than without it, depending on PC configuration. It is recommended to try it with very low-end GPUs.
